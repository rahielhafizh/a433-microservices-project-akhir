This is the final project of the course “Learn to Build Microservices Architecture”. This project implements asynchronous communication in an e-commerce application using Kubernetes and Istio service mesh to improve service reliability and performance. The process involves converting source code into container images, deploying services on Kubernetes, and configuring Istio for traffic management and security policies. Integrating service mesh technologies using microservice architecture, Kubernetes orchestration, and network configuration, creates a scalable and reliable application environment.
